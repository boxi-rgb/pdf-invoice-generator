The math is simple:

Without this tool: 55 min/invoice
With this tool: 30 seconds

At $50/hour, you save $45 per invoice.

**Article:**
# The Story Behind PDF Invoice Generator

As a developer, I've always been frustrated by the time it takes to create professional invoices. Excel templates are clunky, online tools are expensive, and manual creation is time-consuming.

So I built **PDF Invoice Generator** - a simple, open-source solution that creates professional invoices in seconds.

## The Features

```javascript
const invoice = new InvoiceGenerator();
invoice.createInvoice({
  from: "Your Company",
  to: "Client Name",
  items: [{description: "Web Development", price: 1000}]
});
invoice.save("invoice.pdf");
```

- Professional templates
- Automatic calculations
- Multi-currency support
- Open source (MIT license)

## Why I'm Asking for $10

I'm not trying to get rich. I'm looking for my **first supporter** to validate that this tool provides real value.

Your $10 helps:
- Cover hosting costs
- Support ongoing development
- Show that open source can be sustainable

## The Math

Time per invoice without tool: **55 minutes**
Time with tool: **30 seconds**

If you charge $50/hour, each invoice costs you $45 in time.

**One $10 donation saves you thousands.**

## Special Offer

First 10 supporters get:
- Name in the Hall of Fame
- Priority feature requests
- Direct support
- Lifetime updates

## Links

- GitHub: https://github.com/boxi-rgb/pdf-invoice-generator
- Support: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/boxirgb

Let's make open source sustainable, one $10 at a time!

I built a simple tool to create professional invoices quickly. It's open source (MIT license) and saves me hours every month.

The interesting part: I'm experimenting with a "$10 sustainability model" - looking for just one person to validate that this provides $10 worth of value.

Tech stack is vanilla JavaScript to keep it simple and accessible. No frameworks, no build process, just code that works.

Would love feedback on both the tool and the funding approach!
